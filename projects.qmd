Here are some of my projects:

# Mixture of K scaled and shifted t distributions

- [Mixture of K scaled and shifted t distributions](Projects/Mixture_of_K_scaled_and_shifted_Tdistributions.html)

The implementation is made using a combination of R and C++ via the Rcpp library.


# VP-search trees for cgMLST sequences

- [VP-search trees for cgMLST sequences](Projects/VP_search_trees_for_cgMLST_sequences.html)

The implementation is made in python and the report is written in jupyter notebooks.
