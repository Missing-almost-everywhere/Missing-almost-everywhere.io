At the computer science department at KU, there don’t seem to be many courses that adopt a simulated agent-based approach. However, I remember attending a talk organized by the group \"Kritiske Politter\" a long time ago.

This is why the agent-based approach is so interesting to me—it resembles the way physicists would approach a problem.\n\n## This Project\nIn this small project, I will attempt to create a basic framework for simulating agents.

I thought this problem would be a good way to brush up on my object-oriented programming skills.\nThe underlying mathematical approach for these simulations is Monte Carlo simulations.\n\n\n# A Simple Simulation of Markets\nThere is likely a lot of theory on agent-based simulations, but since I am new to this field, I’ll start with a simple simulation of a market. This is a toy example, so if you’re reading this and think some deep theoretical insights can be drawn from this model (a common approach in economic modeling), remember: I HAVE NO DATA.\n\nDuring my microeconomics courses, I worked extensively on building theoretical models and creating narratives or conclusions based on them—without ever looking at real data. While it’s relatively easy to create models of agents, building realistic agents is far more challenging.\n\nIf you are interested in examples of non-rational behavior in humans, I recommend reading Nudge or Predictably Irrational. The latter describes experiments in detail, which I personally enjoy.\n\nSince this job is based in Copenhagen, I’ll simulate \"Strøget,\" the historic shopping district in the city center.\n\n## The Environment (Strøget)\nSince the company is located in Copenhagen, I thought it would be fun to use the city center as the topic of this exercise.\n\nIf we limit Strøget to the area between “Storkespringvandet” and the entrance near City Hall, we can imagine it as a long corridor with shops on both sides. To simplify, we’ll assume there’s one shop at each location along this corridor.\n\nThus, the environment can be represented as a long chain of shops. Agents can start from either end and pass through the corridor.\n\n## The Shopper\nFrom personal experience, it seems that nobody goes to Strøget to buy necessities—it’s more about purchasing nice-to-have items and doing light shopping. I’ll assume people arrive at Strøget with a certain amount of money (cash) they want to spend.\n\nI created some preference classes, such as Food, Clothing, and Books. By making these preferences into classes, I can tailor purchase patterns for each category.\n\nFood: This is consumed only once, meaning if someone buys food, they won’t purchase it again.\nCash: The shopper’s cash balance decreases with each purchase.\nPosition: Tracks where the shopper is located in the chain of shops.\nPresence: Indicates whether the shopper is still on the street.\nWhen a shopper encounters a shop that matches their preferences, they will buy something with a given probability—but only if they can afford it.\n\n## The Shop Agents\nShop agents will offer products at a given price in specific categories. To keep things simple, each shop offers one product in one category.\n\nSimulations\nThe simulation is managed via the Street class.\n\nTo simplify, shops are ordered by their placement along the street. I haven’t implemented checks for errors in the ordering since this is just a toy example.\n\nThe simulation progresses with a tick function, allowing the system to update step by step.\n\nOverall\nOverall, I like this construction. Instead of storing positions in a variable, I could have moved the object itself or used pointers to save computational costs related to copying.\n\n\n# Implementasion\n## Classes\n```{python}\nimport random\n\nclass Shop:\n    def __init__(self, placement: int, category: str, price: int):\n        \"\"\"\n        Represents a shop in the market.\n        :param placement: Position of the shop along the market.\n        :param category: The type of items sold by the shop (e.g., 'Food', 'Books').\n        :param price: The price of the items sold.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.placement = placement\n        self.category = category\n        self.price = price\n        self.units_sold=0\n    \n    def sold_unit(self):\n        self.units_sold +=1\n\n    def turnover(self):\n        return self.units_sold*self.price\n\n\"\"\"The belov class represent prefference a cosumer could have\"\"\"\nclass food:\n    def __init__(self,type,buy_prop,have_eaten=False,units_bought=0):\n        self.type=type\n        self.buy_prop=buy_prop\n        self.have_eaten=have_eaten\n        self.units_bought=units_bought\n    def will_buy(self):\n        return_obj=False\n        if(self.have_eaten==False):\n            return_obj= random.random()< self.buy_prop\n            if(return_obj==True):\n                self.have_eaten=True\n                self.units_bought+=1\n        return (return_obj)\n\nclass cloth:\n    def __init__(self,type,buy_prop,units_bought=0):\n        self.type=type\n        self.buy_prop=buy_prop\n        self.units_bought=units_bought\n    def will_buy(self): \n        return_obj=random.random()< self.buy_prop\n        if return_obj== True: self.units_bought+=1\n        return return_obj\n\nclass book:\n    def __init__(self,type,buy_prop,units_bought=0):\n        self.type=type\n        self.buy_prop=buy_prop\n        self.units_bought=units_bought\n    def will_buy(self):\n        return_obj=random.random()< self.buy_prop\n        if return_obj== True: self.units_bought+=1\n        return return_obj\n\n\nclass Shopper:\n    def __init__(self,placement: int,direction,cash: float,preferences: list):\n        \"\"\"\n        Represents a shopper in the market.\n        :param placement: Current position of the shopper.\n        :param direction: Direction of movement (-1 for left, 1 for right).\n        :param cash: Amount of money the shopper has.\n        :param gender: Gender of the shopper (used for preferences).\n        :param preferences: Dictionary of categories and buy probabilities.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.placement = placement\n        self.direction = direction\n        self.cash = cash\n        self.preferences = preferences  \n        self.has_eaten = False\n        self.has_eaten_dessert = False\n        self.shoper_pressent_at_market=True\n        \n    def update_position(self):\n        \"\"\"This function update the postion of the shopper and updates if their are shoper pressent at market\"\"\"\n        self.placement=self.placement+self.direction\n        return\n    \n    def visit_shop(self, shop: Shop):\n        \"\"\"\n        Interact with a shop and decide whether to buy.\n        :param shop: The shop to interact with.\n        \"\"\"\n        #

However, if I were interested in aggregated data—such as the total units sold—I would need to compute this after each tick by iterating through all the relevant objects.\n\nA more efficient approach could involve maintaining a centralized summary of key metrics during the simulation. For example:\n\n- Total Units Sold: Incremented directly when a sale occurs.\n- Revenue by Category: Updated in real time when a product is purchased.\n\nThis way, aggregated data would be readily available without requiring extra computation after each tick. It would also make it easier to monitor and analyze trends as the simulation progresses.\n\n\n\n```{python}\nimport matplotlib as plt\n\ndef simulate_street():\n    shops = [\n        Shop(placement=0, category=\"food\", price=50),\n        Shop(placement=1, category=\"cloth\", price=200),\n        Shop(placement=2, category=\"book\", price=150),\n        Shop(placement=3, category=\"food\", price=100),\n        Shop(placement=4, category=\"cloth\", price=300),\n        Shop(placement=5, category=\"book\", price=250)\n        ]\n    ticks=len(shops)\n    preferences_1 = [\n        food(type=\"food\", buy_prop=0.8),\n        cloth(type=\"cloth\", buy_prop=0.5),\n        book(type=\"book\", buy_prop=0.6)\n        ]\n    preferences_2 = [\n        food(type=\"food\", buy_prop=0.6),\n        cloth(type=\"cloth\", buy_prop=0.3),\n        book(type=\"book\", buy_prop=0.9)\n        ]\n    shoppers = [\n        Shopper(placement=0, direction=1, cash=500, preferences=random.choice([preferences_1, preferences_2])),\n        Shopper(placement=5, direction=-1, cash=800, preferences=random.choice([preferences_1, preferences_2])),\n        Shopper(placement=2, direction=1, cash=300, preferences=random.choice([preferences_1, preferences_2]))\n        ]\n    # Initialize the shopping street\n    street = shopping_street(list_of_shops=shops, list_of_shopers=shoppers)\n    for _ in range(ticks):\n        street.run_tick()\n\n    # Return a dictionary with the results\n    return {\n        \"Total_units\": street.get_unit(),\n        \"Total_turnover\": street.get_total_turnover()\n    }\n\n\n#plot distibution of sale and and units sold\nTotal_units=[]\nTotal_turnover=[]\nfor i in range(100):\n    sim_obj=simulate_street()\n    Total_units.append(sim_obj[\"Total_units\"])\n    Total_turnover.append(sim_obj[\"Total_turnover\"])\n\n\n\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n\n\n# Create two subplots\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(8, 10))  # 2 rows, 1 column\n\n# Histogram for List A\naxes[0].hist(Total_units, bins=5, color='blue', alpha=0.7)\naxes[0].set_title('Histogram of Total units')\naxes[0].set_xlabel('Value')\naxes[0].set_ylabel('Frequency')\n\n# Histogram for List B\naxes[1].hist(Total_turnover, bins=5, color='orange', alpha=0.7)\naxes[1].set_title('Histogram of Total turnover')\naxes[1].set_xlabel('Value')\naxes[1].set_ylabel('Frequency')\n\n# Adjust layout\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n# Show plots\nplt.show()\n```\n\n# Technical Notes and Suggestions for Improvement\nWhen building simulations or using object-oriented programming, many of the structures can be designed in various ways. For example, the buy function could be implemented as part of the shopper agent or as part of the environment.\n\nMaintaining a well-organized structure is crucial, especially when managing dynamic effects, which can quickly become complex. This is particularly true in economic systems where actors are trained to consider both upstream and downstream effects.\n\n## Downstream Effects\nI believe downstream effects would be simpler to implement. To track these efficiently, I would use a directed graph or a reactive graph (as described in Mastering Shiny). The reactive graph approach could be more efficient for managing dependencies and dynamic changes in the system.\n\n## Parallelization Challenges\nA minor technical detail: as the code is written now, parallelizing the simulation would be challenging. Although the shoppers do not interact directly, they interact with the same shops. This creates a potential issue when writing to shared variables, such as the units sold in a shop. If multiple shoppers update this variable simultaneously, errors could occur.\n\nI am particularly interested in learning how to address these kinds of problems effectively. For example, using locks or other concurrency control methods might help, but exploring more sophisticated solutions could be valuable.\n\n# No Conclusions from the Model\nAs stated at the beginning, this project was designed purely as an exercise in thinking about good structures for this type of model, rather than drawing any conclusions from the simulation.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\n# Introduction\nI am applying for a job where the primary task involves working on and implementing agent-based simulations.\n\nMy background is primarily in mathematics, economics, and statistics.

Instead of storing positions in a variable, I could have moved the object itself or used pointers to save computational costs related to copying.\n\n\n# Implementasion\n## Classes\n```{python}\nimport random\n\nclass Shop:\n    def __init__(self, placement: int, category: str, price: int):\n        \"\"\"\n        Represents a shop in the market.\n        :param placement: Position of the shop along the market.\n        :param category: The type of items sold by the shop (e.g., 'Food', 'Books').\n        :param price: The price of the items sold.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.placement = placement\n        self.category = category\n        self.price = price\n        self.units_sold=0\n    \n    def sold_unit(self):\n        self.units_sold +=1\n\n    def turnover(self):\n        return self.units_sold*self.price\n\n\"\"\"The belov class represent prefference a cosumer could have\"\"\"\nclass food:\n    def __init__(self,type,buy_prop,have_eaten=False,units_bought=0):\n        self.type=type\n        self.buy_prop=buy_prop\n        self.have_eaten=have_eaten\n        self.units_bought=units_bought\n    def will_buy(self):\n        return_obj=False\n        if(self.have_eaten==False):\n            return_obj= random.random()< self.buy_prop\n            if(return_obj==True):\n                self.have_eaten=True\n                self.units_bought+=1\n        return (return_obj)\n\nclass cloth:\n    def __init__(self,type,buy_prop,units_bought=0):\n        self.type=type\n        self.buy_prop=buy_prop\n        self.units_bought=units_bought\n    def will_buy(self): \n        return_obj=random.random()< self.buy_prop\n        if return_obj== True: self.units_bought+=1\n        return return_obj\n\nclass book:\n    def __init__(self,type,buy_prop,units_bought=0):\n        self.type=type\n        self.buy_prop=buy_prop\n        self.units_bought=units_bought\n    def will_buy(self):\n        return_obj=random.random()< self.buy_prop\n        if return_obj== True: self.units_bought+=1\n        return return_obj\n\n\nclass Shopper:\n    def __init__(self,placement: int,direction,cash: float,preferences: list):\n        \"\"\"\n        Represents a shopper in the market.\n        :param placement: Current position of the shopper.\n        :param direction: Direction of movement (-1 for left, 1 for right).\n        :param cash: Amount of money the shopper has.\n        :param gender: Gender of the shopper (used for preferences).\n        :param preferences: Dictionary of categories and buy probabilities.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.placement = placement\n        self.direction = direction\n        self.cash = cash\n        self.preferences = preferences  \n        self.has_eaten = False\n        self.has_eaten_dessert = False\n        self.shoper_pressent_at_market=True\n        \n    def update_position(self):\n        \"\"\"This function update the postion of the shopper and updates if their are shoper pressent at market\"\"\"\n        self.placement=self.placement+self.direction\n        return\n    \n    def visit_shop(self, shop: Shop):\n        \"\"\"\n        Interact with a shop and decide whether to buy.\n        :param shop: The shop to interact with.\n        \"\"\"\n        #

However, if I were interested in aggregated data—such as the total units sold—I would need to compute this after each tick by iterating through all the relevant objects.\n\nA more efficient approach could involve maintaining a centralized summary of key metrics during the simulation. For example:\n\n- Total Units Sold: Incremented directly when a sale occurs.\n- Revenue by Category: Updated in real time when a product is purchased.\n\nThis way, aggregated data would be readily available without requiring extra computation after each tick. It would also make it easier to monitor and analyze trends as the simulation progresses.\n\n\n\n```{python}\nimport matplotlib as plt\n\ndef simulate_street():\n    shops = [\n        Shop(placement=0, category=\"food\", price=50),\n        Shop(placement=1, category=\"cloth\", price=200),\n        Shop(placement=2, category=\"book\", price=150),\n        Shop(placement=3, category=\"food\", price=100),\n        Shop(placement=4, category=\"cloth\", price=300),\n        Shop(placement=5, category=\"book\", price=250)\n        ]\n    ticks=len(shops)\n    preferences_1 = [\n        food(type=\"food\", buy_prop=0.8),\n        cloth(type=\"cloth\", buy_prop=0.5),\n        book(type=\"book\", buy_prop=0.6)\n        ]\n    preferences_2 = [\n        food(type=\"food\", buy_prop=0.6),\n        cloth(type=\"cloth\", buy_prop=0.3),\n        book(type=\"book\", buy_prop=0.9)\n        ]\n    shoppers = [\n        Shopper(placement=0, direction=1, cash=500, preferences=random.choice([preferences_1, preferences_2])),\n        Shopper(placement=5, direction=-1, cash=800, preferences=random.choice([preferences_1, preferences_2])),\n        Shopper(placement=2, direction=1, cash=300, preferences=random.choice([preferences_1, preferences_2]))\n        ]\n    # Initialize the shopping street\n    street = shopping_street(list_of_shops=shops, list_of_shopers=shoppers)\n    for _ in range(ticks):\n        street.run_tick()\n\n    # Return a dictionary with the results\n    return {\n        \"Total_units\": street.get_unit(),\n        \"Total_turnover\": street.get_total_turnover()\n    }\n\n\n#plot distibution of sale and and units sold\nTotal_units=[]\nTotal_turnover=[]\nfor i in range(100):\n    sim_obj=simulate_street()\n    Total_units.append(sim_obj[\"Total_units\"])\n    Total_turnover.append(sim_obj[\"Total_turnover\"])\n\n\n\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n\n\n# Create two subplots\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(8, 10))  # 2 rows, 1 column\n\n# Histogram for List A\naxes[0].hist(Total_units, bins=5, color='blue', alpha=0.7)\naxes[0].set_title('Histogram of Total units')\naxes[0].set_xlabel('Value')\naxes[0].set_ylabel('Frequency')\n\n# Histogram for List B\naxes[1].hist(Total_turnover, bins=5, color='orange', alpha=0.7)\naxes[1].set_title('Histogram of Total turnover')\naxes[1].set_xlabel('Value')\naxes[1].set_ylabel('Frequency')\n\n# Adjust layout\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n# Show plots\nplt.show()\n```\n\n# Technical Notes and Suggestions for Improvement\nWhen building simulations or using object-oriented programming, many of the structures can be designed in various ways. For example, the buy function could be implemented as part of the shopper agent or as part of the environment.\n\nMaintaining a well-organized structure is crucial, especially when managing dynamic effects, which can quickly become complex. This is particularly true in economic systems where actors are trained to consider both upstream and downstream effects.\n\n## Downstream Effects\nI believe downstream effects would be simpler to implement. To track these efficiently, I would use a directed graph or a reactive graph (as described in Mastering Shiny). The reactive graph approach could be more efficient for managing dependencies and dynamic changes in the system.\n\n## Parallelization Challenges\nA minor technical detail: as the code is written now, parallelizing the simulation would be challenging. Although the shoppers do not interact directly, they interact with the same shops. This creates a potential issue when writing to shared variables, such as the units sold in a shop. If multiple shoppers update this variable simultaneously, errors could occur.\n\nI am particularly interested in learning how to address these kinds of problems effectively. For example, using locks or other concurrency control methods might help, but exploring more sophisticated solutions could be valuable.\n\n# No Conclusions from the Model\nAs stated at the beginning, this project was designed purely as an exercise in thinking about good structures for this type of model, rather than drawing any conclusions from the
